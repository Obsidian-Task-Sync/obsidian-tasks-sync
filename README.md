### 2. Install into Obsidian

1. Open your Obsidian Vault.
2. Locate the `.obsidian/plugins/` folder in your vault’s directory.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file into a subfolder named `obsidian-tasks-sync`.

```

    └── plugins/
        └── obsidian-tasks-sync/
            ├── main.js
            ├── manifest.json

Tasks will be synced in both directions once authorized.
