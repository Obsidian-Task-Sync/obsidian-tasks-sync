## Installation

### 1. Download the Release

2. Download the latest `obsidian-tasks-sync.zip` file under **Assets**.


### 2. Install into Obsidian

1. Open your Obsidian Vault.
2. Locate the `.obsidian/plugins/` folder in your vaultâ€™s directory.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file into a subfolder named `obsidian-tasks-sync`.

```
/YourVault/
â””â”€â”€ .obsidian/
    â””â”€â”€ plugins/
        â””â”€â”€ obsidian-tasks-sync/
            â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
            â””â”€â”€ manifest.json
```

4. Restart Obsidian or go to **Settings â†’ Community Plugins** and enable `Obsidian Tasks Sync`.


### 3. Authorize Your Task Platform

If you're using Google Tasks or Todoist:
